Several indie artists evoke a similar atmosphere through their music. Here are 5-10 examples, along with songs that capture their fae-like or mystical energy:\n\n### 1. **Florence + The Machine**\n   - **Song**: *\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\"*  \n     Florence Welch’s music often feels like an incantation, with grandiose vocals and mythological themes. This song, with its references to sacrifice and transformation, carries a mystical aura.\n   \n   - **Song**: *\"What the Water Gave Me\"*  \n     Filled with references to water, drowning, and mythological undertones, this track conveys a deep connection to nature and the spiritual.\n\n### 2. **Agnes Obel**\n   - **Song**: *\"Riverside\"*  \n     Obel’s minimalistic, haunting piano arrangements and her delicate, ethereal voice give her music an otherworldly quality. \"Riverside\" evokes both melancholy and the mystical flow of time and nature.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"Fuel to Fire\"*  \n     This track has an eerie, spellbinding quality, with dark folk influences that feel as if it’s from another realm.\n\n### 3. **AURORA**\n   - **Song**: *\"Runaway\"*  \n     Norwegian artist AURORA often sings about nature, dreams, and escape. \"Runaway\" speaks of returning to nature and a longing for another world, a central theme in fae-like mysticism.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"The Seed\"*  \n     A song steeped in environmental themes, \"The Seed\" taps into the primal energy of the earth, delivering a powerful, almost pagan chant.\n\n### 4. **Sufjan Stevens**\n   - **Song**: *\"Mystery of Love\"*  \n     Known for his intricate storytelling and delicate instrumentation, Stevens’ music often feels fragile and otherworldly. \"Mystery of Love,\" featured in *Call Me by Your Name*, feels like a hymn to lost beauty and love, reminiscent of mythic themes.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"Should Have Known Better\"*  \n     This song balances sorrow with transcendence, giving the listener a feeling of floating in a mythical, liminal space.\n\n### 5. **Fleet Foxes**\n   - **Song**: *\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\"*  \n     This band’s pastoral, nature-inspired lyrics and harmonies have a distinctly fae quality. \"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\" speaks of death and the natural world with a kind of reverence and mystery.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"Mykonos\"*  \n     A song with intricate, mythical undertones that suggests a journey to an ancient place, full of wonder and introspection.\n\n### 6. **Weyes Blood**\n   - **Song**: *\"Andromeda\"*  \n     Weyes Blood’s cosmic, dreamy soundscapes feel like they’re pulling from both ancient myth and the future. \"Andromeda\" references mythology directly, grounding the song in celestial, mystical themes.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"Movies\"*  \n     This track has an expansive, otherworldly feel that mirrors the grandeur and surrealism of dreams and myths.\n\n### 7. **Chelsea Wolfe**\n   - **Song**: *\"Feral Love\"*  \n     Known for blending folk, doom, and gothic influences, Chelsea Wolfe’s music is dark, mystical, and haunting. \"Feral Love\" sounds primal and otherworldly, invoking themes of wildness and untamed spirits.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"Carrion Flowers\"*  \n     This track’s atmospheric, darkly ethereal sound feels like it could be the background music for a journey through an enchanted forest or a gothic fairy tale.\n\n### 8. **The Decemberists**\n   - **Song**: *\"The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned)\"*  \n     This track, from their concept album *The Hazards of Love*, is steeped in folk storytelling and mystical tragedy, following the theme of forbidden love and supernatural forces.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"Crane Wife 3\"*  \n     Based on a Japanese folk tale, this song blends myth with heartache and longing, creating a mood that is timeless and otherworldly.\n\n### 9. **Julien Baker**\n   - **Song**: *\"Appointments\"*  \n     Baker’s stripped-down, emotional songs have an almost spectral quality. \"Appointments\" is deeply introspective, evoking a feeling of isolation that seems to echo in a vast, otherworldly space.\n\n   - **Song**: *\"Faith Healer\"*  \n     This track has a subtle mysticism, exploring the nature of faith and healing, both physical and spiritual, with an ethereal sound.\n\nThese artists and their selected songs echo the same kind of mythical, fae-like presence that Hozier has, blending themes of nature, mysticism, and the spiritual into haunting and timeless music.\n\n\n---\n\n### Credits\n\nPhoto by RDNE Stock project: https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-shot-of-a-lighted-candle-7978814/\n"}],"allTags":["artist:sufjan stevens","artist:hozier","artist:nick cave","artist:chris isaak","artist:alt-j","artist:bon iver","artist:joy division","artist:nina simone","artist:patsy cline","artist:echo & the bunnymen","artist:the doors","artist:the black angels","artist:electric guest","theme:beats","artist:m83","artist:tom yorke","artist:jamie xx","artist:romy","artist:jonathan wilson","artist:fka twigs","artist:the xx","artist:desire","artist:washed out","artist:radiohead","theme:tvshow","artist:phoebe bridgers","artist:dermont kennedy","artist:rex orange county","artist:tame impala","artist:mac demarco","artist:lizzy mcalpine","artist:arlo parks","arist:dayglow","artist:glass animals","artist:ben howard","artist:japanese breakfast","artist:the 1975","artist:clairo","theme:indie","theme:folk","artist:florence+themachine","artist:agnes obel","artist:aurora","artist:fleet foxes","artist:weyes blood","artist:chelsea wolfe","artist:the decemberists","theme:moody","theme:spooky","artist:the zombies","artist:the animals","artist: marianne faithfull","artist:vicki lawrence","artist:johnny cash","artist:the band","artist:bruce springsteen","theme:storm","artist:her","artist:lord huron","artist:oh wonder","artist:wet","artist:st vincent","meta"]},"__N_SSG":true}
