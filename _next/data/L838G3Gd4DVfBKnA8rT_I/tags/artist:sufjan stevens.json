For example, the \"how to save a life\" tragic scene. The \"dirty minds\" sex scene. Plus countless other relatively unknown songs that shaped the series. If scrubs was remade in 2024, can you give examples of an updated soundtrack for pivotal scenes, and songs or artists that git the scrubs vibe in general\n\n\n--- \n\n### Response\n\nIf *Scrubs* were remade in 2024, the soundtrack would likely need to capture the same emotional depth, humor, and relatability while incorporating modern artists and trends. The original show was masterful at using music to underscore both comedic and heart-wrenching moments, often turning lesser-known songs into memorable TV moments. Here's an updated soundtrack suggestion for pivotal scenes:\n\n### 1. **Tragic/Emotional Moments**  \nThese scenes are where *Scrubs* excelled at using soft, haunting tracks to tug at the heartstrings.\n\n- **Phoebe Bridgers - \"Motion Sickness\"**  \n  Bridgers’ vulnerable voice and introspective lyrics would be a perfect modern fit for those melancholic, tear-jerking moments.  \n- **Dermot Kennedy - \"Outnumbered\"**  \n  Kennedy's mix of powerful vocals and emotional storytelling fits well in scenes of loss or contemplation.  \n- **Sufjan Stevens - \"Should Have Known Better\"**  \n  Stevens’ soft, yet deeply emotional style captures the bittersweet tone of the show’s more serious episodes.\n  \n### 2. **Comedic/Lighthearted Moments**  \nScrubs often balanced its heavier moments with goofy, whimsical ones. The following songs would maintain that light, playful energy.\n\n- **Rex Orange County - \"Loving Is Easy\"**  \n  This upbeat track feels perfect for J.D.'s daydreams or goofy moments between him and Turk.  \n- **Tame Impala - \"The Less I Know The Better\"**  \n  A funky, playful song that could underscore awkward, funny situations or romantic hijinks.  \n- **Mac DeMarco - \"Freaking Out the Neighborhood\"**  \n  DeMarco's quirky sound would fit the show's offbeat, humorous scenes, especially those involving J.D.'s awkwardness.\n\n### 3. **Romantic Scenes**  \nWhen *Scrubs* tackled romance, it was often bittersweet or filled with longing.\n\n- **Hozier - \"Like Real People Do\"**  \n  Hozier’s soulful, folky sound could work for tender, intimate moments between characters.  \n- **Lizzy McAlpine - \"Ceilings\"**  \n  McAlpine's lyrics about romantic miscommunication and dreamy melodies would add emotional weight to love scenes.  \n- **Arlo Parks - \"Caroline\"**  \n  Parks’ poetic storytelling and soft instrumentals would enhance emotionally complex romantic encounters.\n\n### 4. **Inspirational/Feel-Good Moments**  \nFor those “we’ve learned something today” moments that wrap up an episode with a hopeful or positive tone:\n\n- **Dayglow - \"Can I Call You Tonight?\"**  \n  Dayglow’s optimistic indie-pop sound could play over feel-good, reflective moments.\n- **Glass Animals - \"Heat Waves\"**  \n  This song's uplifting energy and reflective lyrics would work for scenes where characters find hope or understanding.  \n- **Ben Howard - \"Keep Your Head Up\"**  \n  A fitting track for moments of perseverance and hope that characterized a lot of the show's more optimistic endings.\n\n### 5. **General Artists That Capture the *Scrubs* Vibe in 2024**  \nThe show often used songs that felt introspective but accessible, often by artists who weren’t chart-toppers but had cult followings. These artists fit that mold:\n\n- **Japanese Breakfast**  \n  Her blend of melancholy and dream pop captures the whimsical yet emotionally rich vibe of *Scrubs*.  \n- **Bon Iver**  \n  Known for deeply emotional and atmospheric songs, Bon Iver could easily score the more dramatic and introspective moments.  \n- **The 1975**  \n  With their mix of pop and emotional introspection, The 1975 would provide a modern equivalent of the catchy yet meaningful songs *Scrubs* was known for.  \n- **Clairo**  \n  Clairo’s bedroom pop sound fits the introspective, bittersweet mood of many *Scrubs* episodes, particularly her softer, emotional tracks.\n\nThese tracks and artists would modernize the *Scrubs* soundtrack while staying true to its legacy of using music to punctuate comedy, romance, and emotional depth.\n\n---\n\n### Credits\n\nPhoto by Tima Miroshnichenko: https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photo-of-an-x-ray-held-by-a-doctor-5452281/"},{"id":"20241105_fae_and_folklore","title":"Fae & folklore","date":"2024-11-05","tagline":"Hozier's mystical, otherworldly vibe is characterized by his haunting lyrics, ethereal soundscapes, and deep connection to nature and myth","image":"/deep-track-ai/img/posts/pexels-rdne.jpg","tags":["theme:indie","theme:folk","artist:hozier","artist:florence+themachine","artist:agnes obel","artist:aurora","artist:sufjan stevens","artist:fleet foxes","artist:weyes blood","artist:chelsea wolfe","artist:the decemberists"],"playlist":"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2vr5VSY78lXvaYEMnmK59U?utm_source=generator","content":"\n---- \n\n### AI Prompt\n\n> The artist Hozier is often joked (maybe not a joke) about being a mythical fae being.
