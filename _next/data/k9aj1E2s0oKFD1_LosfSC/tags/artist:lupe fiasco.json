Give a serious answer. A fun answer. Then the artists\n\n\n--- \n\n### Response\n\n#### **Serious Answer:**  \n\"Dance Party Skateboarding Hip Hop\" might be a genre that combines the high-energy, bass-heavy beats of dance music with the raw, rebellious vibe of skateboarding culture and the lyrical storytelling of hip hop. It could feature upbeat tempos, heavy use of synths and drum machines, layered with scratches, samples, and the lyrical style of rap. Themes might include street culture, individuality, and community, with an overall vibe that’s as much about movement as it is about expression.\n\nStylistically, this genre would draw from:  \n- **Dance music**: Energetic house, electro, and even disco influences.\n- **Hip hop**: Classic boom-bap beats, trap rhythms, and freestyle flows.\n- **Skateboarding culture**: A DIY punk edge, unconventional song structures, and gritty aesthetics.\n\nThe genre might appeal to fans of music festivals, urban art, and subcultures where creative energy thrives.\n\n---\n\n#### **Fun Answer:**  \nImagine a crew of skateboarders throwing a late-night rooftop dance party where everyone wears neon clothes, ollies off couches, and freestyle raps in between flips. The DJ spins records that make people vibe and nod along but also turn heads with wild, genre-bending beats. Tracks might open with a thunderous bass drop, transition into a lo-fi rap verse, and end with a scratchy guitar riff sampled from an old punk song. This is music you’d blast while perfecting your kickflip or just cruising down the street with a boombox strapped to your deck.  \n\nThe aesthetic would include:\n- **Skate video soundtracks**: High energy and DIY vibes.\n- **Festival-ready beats**: Perfect for hyping up a crowd or landing tricks with style.\n- **Lyrics**: A mix of playful brags about tricks, heartfelt odes to the skatepark, and philosophical musings during late-night skate sessions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Artists Representing This Genre:**\n1. **Run-D.M.C.** – Hip hop pioneers who fused rap with rock, inspiring skateboarding culture.\n2. **Beastie Boys** – Their irreverent style, rap-rock experiments, and punk roots align perfectly.\n3. **Lupe Fiasco** – Known for \"Kick, Push,\" an anthem for skateboarding life.\n4. **A Tribe Called Quest** – Smooth, jazzy beats mixed with hip hop's lyrical depth.\n5. **Pharrell Williams/N.E.R.D.** – Fuses funk, skate culture, and experimental sounds.\n6. **MF DOOM** – Lo-fi beats and skate-friendly underground credibility.\n7. **Odd Future/Wolf Gang (Tyler, The Creator & Earl Sweatshirt)** – Skateboarding roots and boundary-pushing hip hop.\n8. **Flume** – Dance music producer with energetic, experimental vibes.\n9. **Kaytranada** – Funky, danceable beats with a hip hop edge.\n10. **Thundercat** – Funk-infused tracks that skate between genres.\n11. **Anderson .Paak** – Groove-heavy tunes that could fuel a skate session.\n12. **DJ Shadow** – Turntablism and skate culture's preferred soundscapes.\n13. **Death Grips** – Chaotic and energetic, bringing the raw edge of skate culture.\n14. **Jaden Smith** – Skateboarding influence with futuristic hip hop vibes. \n\n---\n\n### Credits\n\nPhoto by RDNE Stock project from Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-in-pink-crop-top-and-jogging-pants-doing-jump-shot-inside-a-night-club-9089256/\n\nThanks for the new exciting new genre, Spotify!\n"}],"allTags":["artist:sufjan stevens","artist:hozier","spotify unwrapped","theme:indie","artist:fleet foxes","artist:agnes obel","artist:the decemberists","artist:nick cave","artist:chris isaak","artist:alt-j","artist:bon iver","artist:the oh hellos","artist:faun","artist:iron & wine","artist:cosmo sheldrake","artist:hollow coves","artist:loreena mckennitt","artist:gillian welch","artist:andrew bird","artist:angus & julia stone","artist:voka gentle","theme:hip hop","artist:run dmc","artist:beastie boys","artist:lupe fiasco","artist:a tribe called quest","artist:pharrel williams","artist:nerd","artist:mf doom","artist:odd future","artist: tyler, the creator","artist:flume","artist:kaytranada","artist:anderson .paak"," artist:dj shadow","artist:run the jewels","artist:dead trips","artist:jaden smith","artist:joy division","artist:nina simone","artist:patsy cline","artist:echo & the bunnymen","artist:the doors","artist:the black angels","artist:electric guest","theme:beats","artist:m83","artist:tom yorke","artist:jamie xx","artist:romy","artist:jonathan wilson","artist:fka twigs","artist:the xx","artist:desire","artist:washed out","artist:radiohead","theme:tvshow","artist:phoebe bridgers","artist:dermont kennedy","artist:rex orange county","artist:tame impala","artist:mac demarco","artist:lizzy mcalpine","artist:arlo parks","arist:dayglow","artist:glass animals","artist:ben howard","artist:japanese breakfast","artist:the 1975","artist:clairo","theme:folk","artist:florence+themachine","artist:aurora","artist:weyes blood","artist:chelsea wolfe","theme:moody","theme:spooky","artist:the zombies","artist:the animals","artist: marianne faithfull","artist:vicki lawrence","artist:johnny cash","artist:the band","artist:bruce springsteen","theme:storm","artist:her","artist:lord huron","artist:oh wonder","artist:wet","artist:st vincent","meta"]},"__N_SSG":true}
