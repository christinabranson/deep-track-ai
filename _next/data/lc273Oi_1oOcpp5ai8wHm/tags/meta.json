Yes, everything is AI now. It's going to take our jobs. It's going to murder us all. You can't trust your eyes or ears because now everything can be fake.\n\nIt's scary, sure.\n\nBut, its a pretty damn cool tool, and I think I've found a good use case for it. **Music discovery**\n\nWith Deep Track AI, my goal is to harness the power of generative AI to surface new and underappreciated music, create connections between artists and genres, and introduce you to tracks that resonate deeply. Whether itâ€™s uncovering an indie artist from halfway across the world or drawing parallels between your favorite band and a lesser-known pioneer, I want this blog to inspire a new way of exploring music.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nI'm going to be asking questions like:\n\n> What are some relatively unknown collaborators of **<insert-artist-here>**?\n\nor\n\n> What are some of the lesser known writing or musical contribitions that **<insert-artist-here>** has made on other projects?\n\nor\n\n> If the move **<insert-movie>** were made in 2024, what would be a more modern soundtrack that kept the same vibes?\n\n\n----\n\n### Credits\n\nPhoto by Stas Knop from Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-holding-cassette-1319799/\n"}],"allTags":["artist:her","artist:lord huron","artist:hozier","artist:oh wonder","artist:alt-j","artist:sufjan stevens","artist:bon iver","artist:wet","artist:st vincent","theme:halloween","theme:storm","meta","first post"]},"__N_SSG":true}
