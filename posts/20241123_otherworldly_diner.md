Here’s a list of 10 songs that might be playing on the jukebox in this strange, otherworldly diner in the middle of nowhere—evoking a mix of eerie, mysterious, and surreal vibes as you step into a suspiciously lively place at night:

1. **"Shadowplay" – Joy Division**

3. **"I Put a Spell on You" – Screamin' Jay Hawkins**  
   - Haunting and theatrical, like something supernatural is lurking behind the lively atmosphere.

4. **"Strange" – Patsy Cline**  
   - Classic country with a melancholy vibe, but in this context, it feels oddly out of place—intentionally so.

5. **"Hotel California" – Eagles**

9. **"Black Grease" – The Black Angels**  
   - Dark and droning, with a gritty energy that makes you question the true nature of this place.

10. **"Waves" – Electric Guest**  
   - Upbeat yet subtly unnerving, like the energy in the room is just a little *too* high for the circumstances.

These songs combine an eerie, dreamlike quality with hints of danger, mystery, and the supernatural—fitting for a jukebox that might be playing in an otherworldly diner in the deep, deserted woods.
