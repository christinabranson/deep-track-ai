### AI Prompt

> Can you give me some songs that embody an "american gothic"/ moody / spooky vibe?

And when it didn't quite give me enough:

> Well I don't think an American Gothic playlist is complete without "A Rose For Emily"? Can you give me more songs like that, especially if they're inspired by period stories?
