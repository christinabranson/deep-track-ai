### Response

Hozier's mystical, otherworldly vibe, often associated with Celtic folklore and the fae, is characterized by his haunting lyrics, ethereal soundscapes, and deep connection to nature and myth. Several indie artists evoke a similar atmosphere through their music. Here are 5-10 examples, along with songs that capture their fae-like or mystical energy:

### 1. **Florence + The Machine**
   - **Song**: *"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)"*  
     Florence Welch’s music often feels like an incantation, with grandiose vocals and mythological themes. This song, with its references to sacrifice and transformation, carries a mystical aura.
   
   - **Song**: *"What the Water Gave Me"*  
     Filled with references to water, drowning, and mythological undertones, this track conveys a deep connection to nature and the spiritual.

### 2. **Agnes Obel**
   - **Song**: *"Riverside"*  
     Obel’s minimalistic, haunting piano arrangements and her delicate, ethereal voice give her music an otherworldly quality. "Riverside" evokes both melancholy and the mystical flow of time and nature.

   - **Song**: *"Fuel to Fire"*  
     This track has an eerie, spellbinding quality, with dark folk influences that feel as if it’s from another realm.

### 3. **AURORA**
   - **Song**: *"Runaway"*  
     Norwegian artist AURORA often sings about nature, dreams, and escape. "Runaway" speaks of returning to nature and a longing for another world, a central theme in fae-like mysticism.

   - **Song**: *"The Seed"*  
     A song steeped in environmental themes, "The Seed" taps into the primal energy of the earth, delivering a powerful, almost pagan chant.

### 4. **Sufjan Stevens**
   - **Song**: *"Mystery of Love"*  
     Known for his intricate storytelling and delicate instrumentation, Stevens’ music often feels fragile and otherworldly. "Mystery of Love," featured in *Call Me by Your Name*, feels like a hymn to lost beauty and love, reminiscent of mythic themes.

   - **Song**: *"Should Have Known Better"*  
     This song balances sorrow with transcendence, giving the listener a feeling of floating in a mythical, liminal space.

### 5. **Fleet Foxes**
   - **Song**: *"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song"*  
     This band’s pastoral, nature-inspired lyrics and harmonies have a distinctly fae quality. "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song" speaks of death and the natural world with a kind of reverence and mystery.

   - **Song**: *"Mykonos"*  
     A song with intricate, mythical undertones that suggests a journey to an ancient place, full of wonder and introspection.

### 6. **Weyes Blood**
   - **Song**: *"Andromeda"*  
     Weyes Blood’s cosmic, dreamy soundscapes feel like they’re pulling from both ancient myth and the future. "Andromeda" references mythology directly, grounding the song in celestial, mystical themes.

   - **Song**: *"Movies"*  
     This track has an expansive, otherworldly feel that mirrors the grandeur and surrealism of dreams and myths.

### 7. **Chelsea Wolfe**
   - **Song**: *"Feral Love"*  
     Known for blending folk, doom, and gothic influences, Chelsea Wolfe’s music is dark, mystical, and haunting. "Feral Love" sounds primal and otherworldly, invoking themes of wildness and untamed spirits.

   - **Song**: *"Carrion Flowers"*  
     This track’s atmospheric, darkly ethereal sound feels like it could be the background music for a journey through an enchanted forest or a gothic fairy tale.

### 8. **The Decemberists**
   - **Song**: *"The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned)"*  
     This track, from their concept album *The Hazards of Love*, is steeped in folk storytelling and mystical tragedy, following the theme of forbidden love and supernatural forces.

   - **Song**: *"Crane Wife 3"*  
     Based on a Japanese folk tale, this song blends myth with heartache and longing, creating a mood that is timeless and otherworldly.

### 9. **Julien Baker**
   - **Song**: *"Appointments"*  
     Baker’s stripped-down, emotional songs have an almost spectral quality. "Appointments" is deeply introspective, evoking a feeling of isolation that seems to echo in a vast, otherworldly space.

   - **Song**: *"Faith Healer"*  
     This track has a subtle mysticism, exploring the nature of faith and healing, both physical and spiritual, with an ethereal sound.

These artists and their selected songs echo the same kind of mythical, fae-like presence that Hozier has, blending themes of nature, mysticism, and the spiritual into haunting and timeless music.
