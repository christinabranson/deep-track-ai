## aka, It's 2024 and clearly we need another blog about GenAI.

Yes, it's 2024. Yes, everything is AI now. It's going to take our jobs. It's going to murder us all. You can't trust your eyes or ears because now everything can be fake.

It's scary, sure.

But, its a pretty damn cool tool, and I think I've found a good use case for it. **Music discovery**

I'm going to be asking questions like:

> What are some relatively unknown collaborators of **<insert-artist-here>**?

or

> What are some of the lesser known writing or musical contribitions that **<insert-artist-here>** has made on other projects?

or

> If the move **<insert-movie>** were made in 2024, what would be a more modern soundtrack that kept the same vibes?
